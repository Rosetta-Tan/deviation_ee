This project is on quantum chaos. It's widely believed that scrambling Hamiltonians' highly excited states, more specifically those lying in the middle of the spectrum, are effectively described by random states. The entanglement entropy of a reduced density matrix obtained from random states follows the famous Page curve. However, we reveal the phenomenon that the entanglement entropy of mid-spectrum eigenstates of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model **<u>deviates</u>** from that of random states by a constant regardless of the system size. This means the middle part of the spectrum of SYK model is **<u>not</u>** precisely described by Page curve.
